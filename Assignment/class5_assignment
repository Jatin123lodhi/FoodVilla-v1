What is the difference between Name Export,Default export
and * as export ? 

Named export - 

we have to use curly braces while importing
the named export

some declarations- 
export let name1,name2
export const name1=1,nam2=2
export class ClassName{}



Default export - 

while importing we don't need to use
curly braces

one module can have only one default export
and mutiple named export

when importing the named export must be 
referred by exact same name
but default export can be imported with any
name

some declartions-
export default expression
export default function functionName(){}


Export * as -

exports everything from that the module
also known as aggregating modules

some declartion- 
export * from "module-name"
export * as name1 from "module-name"
